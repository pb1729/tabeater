# Tab Eater

A local webapp that saves your firefox tabs. Just run `python tabeater` and go to the suggested link (should be `http://localhost:8000`).

Tabs belong to sessions, the current session is the top one, sessions farther in the past are farther down.

Things you can do with tabs:
* close the tab
* lock or unlock a tab in the current session

Locked tabs will persist even when you close the tab in the browser.
